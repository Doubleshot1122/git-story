Once upon a time there was a drug dealing dragon named Ron. Ron's favorite rapper was MF Doom. Ron had a nasty habit of molesting hedgehogs.

Which was totes okay, because the hedgehogs had a nasty habit of molesting Ron.

But the hedgehogs weren't satisfied. They called for a council of all the woodland critters.  


Because it was time to take care of Ron, but Ron was aware of the council and was ready for them.
